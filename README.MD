## Course Overview

In this winter school, we will build on open-source foundations, focusing 
on [Brightway](https://github.com/brightway-lca), [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser), [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst), [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise) and [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM), 
to make our inventory models better fit research questions with a temporal 
dimension. The instructors will be:

- **Romain Sacchi**: Developer of [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise), [Pathways](https://github.com/polca/pathways) and [Carculator](https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator)
- **Karin Treyer**: Spearheads [Brightway’s online learning material](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) focusing on novice users

The course will cover [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/)’s basics and best practices for model development, 
including the use of Jupyter notebooks and the [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser). 
Essential LCA aspects such as importing inventories from excel, calculating LCIA results, sensitivity analysis, multiple types of 
uncertainty, or parametrization, will be taught. We will also introduce the use of [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM) for combining LCA with Material Flow Analysis (MFA)
and the use of [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst) for consistent manipulation of LCA inventories.

## Course Structure
This tree-day course will consist of lectures together with hands-on exercises.

## Target Audience
