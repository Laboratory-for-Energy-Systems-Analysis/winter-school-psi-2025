## Course Overview

In this winter school, we will build on open-source foundations, focusing 
on [Brightway](https://github.com/brightway-lca), [Activity Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser), [Wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst), [Premise](https://github.com/polca/premise) and [ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM), 
to make our inventory models better fit research questions with a temporal 
dimension. The instructors will be:

- **Romain Sacchi**: Developer of Premise
- **Karin Treyer**: Spearheads Brightway’s online learning materials focusing on novice users

The course will cover Brightway’s basics and best practices for model development, 
including the use of Jupyter notebooks and the Activity Browser. 
Essential LCA aspects such as sensitivity analysis, multiple types of 
uncertainty, parametrization, and best practices in software architecture 
will be taught. We will also introduce the use of ODYM for dynamic LCA
and the use of Wurst for temporal disaggregation of LCA inventories.

## Course Structure
This tree-day course will consist of lectures together with hands-on exercises.

## Target Audience
This winter school is aimed at students who wish to become familiar with 
the Brightway ecosystem, specifically targeting beginner and intermediate
